      <p  class="text-justify mt-4">Hello! I'm <strong>Mageshwar S</strong>.I am a Backend Software Engineer with 3 years of experience in designing, maintaining, and optimizing enterprise applications. My work has spanned legacy services modernization, REST API development, microservices architecture, and cloud-native deployments using AWS (EC2, Auto Scaling, R53, CloudTrail), Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.</p>
      <p  class="text-justify mt-4">My technical toolkit includes Java, Python, NodeJS, TypeScript, Spring, REST APIs, Cassandra (NoSQL DB), Git, and AWS services. I also have experience in observability and monitoring, leveraging Elasticsearch, Grafana, and logging frameworks to ensure application performance, reliability, and scalability. Additionally, I have worked with infrastructure automation (Terraform, Packer) and CI/CD Pipelines (Concourse) to deliver secure and efficient systems.</p>
      <p  class="text-justify mt-4">As part of an Agile development framework, I actively contributed to scrum ceremonies‚Äîincluding daily stand-ups, sprint planning, backlog refinement, and retrospectives‚Äîto ensure collaborative progress, timely delivery, and continuous improvement within cross-functional teams.</p>
      <p  class="text-justify mt-4">Beyond backend engineering, I bring strong analytical problem-solving skills and am actively expanding into Data Analytics and Data Engineering. My background in Python, SQL, AWS, and cloud automation positions me well to work with data pipelines, ETL processes, distributed databases, and data-driven decision-making.</p>
      <p  class="text-justify mt-4">Alongside technology, I have a keen interest in International Relations and Economics/Finance, as I believe that global perspectives and economic literacy are crucial to shaping a sustainable and equitable future. I am also passionate about contributing to transforming the education system‚Äîto nurture critical thinking, innovation, and opportunity for the next generation.</p>
